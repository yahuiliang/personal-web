        <p>About:</p>
        <p>
          I am in my third year of studies towards a bachelor's in Software Engineering and Computer Engineering.
          I love programming. C++ is my favorite language since it is the first computer language that I heard from others.
          I am confident at my programming skills. Since "unmaintainable code=useless characters" in my opinion,
          I never write code which is unable to be read and maintained. Software is changing how people lives now,
          and I believe that I am the one who will change the world.
